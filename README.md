# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a study guide webpage that I created for my Boot Camp experience. This was created as part of the prework assignments in order to learn some coding basics. We worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I added notes and steps that I thought were important to remember and have them in an easy to access location for the future.

## Usage

This study guide can be used to review notes taken on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. It can also be used to find procedural steps, like Git Flow. If you open the DevTools console, you will see that there is some JavaScript running that is meant to help the user pick a topic to study first. The study topic will change as the page is refreshed.
